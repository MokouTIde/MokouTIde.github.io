## Riemann manifold MALA and HMC

The idea of the **Riemann manifold Langevian and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo** methods is to perform the Langevin or Hamiltonian simulations in a suitable Riemann manifold instead of the Euclidean space.

The squared distance between two locations $\theta$ and $\theta+d\theta$ in Euclidean space is given by
```math
d^2=d\theta^Td\theta
```
In the Riemann manifold, the distance is generalized to be
```math
d^2=d\theta^TG^{-1}(\theta)d\theta
```
where $G(\theta)$ is the metric tensor, which is a positive definite matrix for any given $\theta$.

## MMALA

We can now modify the MALA method such that the SDE evolves along the Riemann manifold instead of the Euclidean space as follows:
```math
d\theta(\tau)=\tilde{f}(\theta(t))d\tau+d\tilde{b}(\tau)
```
where
```math
\tilde{f}(\theta)=\frac{1}{2}G^{-1}(\theta)\nabla log\pi(\theta)
```

```math
d\tilde{b}_i=|G(\theta)|^{-1/2}\sum_{j}^{}\frac{\partial}{\partial\theta_j}[G^{-1}(\theta)_{ij}]|G(\theta)|^{-1/2}dt+[G^{-1/2}(\theta)db]_i
```

The MMALA algorithm can now be constructed by replacing the SDE in the basic MALA with the SDE defined above.

## RMHMC

In the Riemann manifold Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (RMHMC) we construct the particle system dynamics in the Riemann manifold. This results in the following Hamiltonian:
```math
H(\theta,\rho)=-log\pi(\theta)+\frac{1}{2}log[2\pi G(\theta)]+\frac{1}{2}\rho^TG^{-1}(\theta)\rho
```
and the Hamiltonian equations are now given as
```math
\frac{d\theta}{d\tau}=\nabla_\rho H=G^{-1}\theta\rho
```

```math
\frac{d\rho}{d\tau}=-\nabla_\theta H=\nabla log\pi(\theta)+h(\theta)
```

where the additional term is given by
```math
h_i(\theta)=-\frac{1}{2}tr\left\{G^{-1}(\theta)\frac{\partial G(\theta)}{\partial\theta_i}\right\}+\frac{1}{2}\rho^T G^{-1}\theta\frac{\partial G(\theta)}{\partial\theta_i}G^{-1}(\theta)\rho
```
